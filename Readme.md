# Buttonlog
**Buttonlog** is a free [open-source](https://github.com/sahlet-official/buttonlog) mobile app for logging device buttons events.<br>
**Buttonlog** is developed and published by [**Freedom Toys**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/freedom-toys/) company.<br>
With **Buttonlog** you can view your button events log and filter records.<br>

## Motivation
The app was made as a [proof of concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept) for another app - [**Sleeplog** - TODO: link to the app in Google Play](https://github.com/sahlet-official/sleeplog).<br>
The idea was to prove that it's convenient to mark when you did not sleep by pressing the button<br>
before you sleep and in the morning app will show you when the last press was.<br>
Also, the **Buttonlog** app is the first iteration of [Sleeplog app development](https://github.com/sahlet-official/sleeplog).<br>
The team of authors of the program consists mainly of students.<br>
So it was decided to split the development process into iterations and execute the implementation step by step.<br>
With this approach, it is much easier for a team of young professionals firstly to design, implement,<br>
and produce a small and simple app to master the best practices for conducting a workflow, and then go further.<br>
