#### Scenarios
1. Developer story. [TODO: issue reference]()<br>
**On device button event scenario**.<br>
When **on device button event scenario** is launched - then the storage of the log should be updated,<br>
and if it is **Active state** of the app - then the view of the log should be updated regarding the **filter text input** content.<br>
2. User story. [TODO: issue reference]()<br>
**Clear log scenario**.<br>
As a user, I want to have an option to clear the log.<br>
When **clear log scenario** is launched - it opens the **clear log confirmation window**.<br>
4. User story. [TODO: issue reference]()<br>
**On filter text changed scenario**.<br>
5. Product Owner story. [TODO: issue reference]()<br>
**Show About scenario**.<br>
When **show About scenario** is launched - it **About app screen** opens.<br>
6. User story. [TODO: issue reference]()<br>
**Quit app scenario**.<br>
As a user, I want to have an option to quit tha app.<br>
When a **quit app scenario** is launched - then the app closes.<br>
<br>

#### Events
1. Developer story. [TODO: issue reference]()<br>
**On device button event**.<br>
When some device physical button was pressed - the **on device button event scenario** should be launched.
2. Developer story. [TODO: issue reference]()<br>
**On paused**.<br>
...
3. Developer story. [TODO: issue reference]()<br>
**On actived**.<br>
...
4. Developer story. [TODO: issue reference]()<br>
**On opened**.<br>
...
<br>

#### States
**Closed state** - the app is closed.<br>
**Active state** - the app is application visible on the screen.<br>
**Paused state** - the app is not in **active state** and not in **closed state**.<br>
1. Developer story. [TODO: issue reference]()<br>
**Closed state**.<br>
If the app is not running, there should be background process<br>
to be able to handle **on device button event**.
