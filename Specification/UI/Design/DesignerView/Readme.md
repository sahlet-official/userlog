Buttonlog UX/UI View by Designer.<br>
Task: develop UX/UI for the Buttonlog application.<br>
To achieve the result, the following criteria were set for UX markup:<br>
- design should be user-oriented;
- UX markup should have a minimum of screens;
- design should be implementable for developers;

Based on UX requirements and Product Owner requirements, the following specifications were developed for the UI:
- style: minimalism;
  
The UX scheme was based on the scheme from [ProdOwnerView.md](./../ProdOwnerView#readme).

After [clarification](./Iteration1.md) of the task, the following changes were made to the customer's UX scheme:
- the side drop-down menu was removed and replaced with a lower central menu;

After 1st iteration of UI developing such changes were made:
- color palette: white, black and shades;

The development of the UI was divided into iterations.<br>
The results of each iteration have been added to the repository, accompanied by a link to the [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) document.<br>

As a result, there is such list of iterations:
- [Iteration1.md](./Iteration1.md);
- [Iteration2.md](./Iteration2.md);
- [Iteration3.md](./Iteration3.md);
  
The last iteration was taken as the resulting [approved design](./../ApprovedDesign#readme).
