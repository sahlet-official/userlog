ButtonLog UX/UI View by Designer

Task: develop ux/ui for the button log application.

To achieve the result, the following criteria were set for ux markup:
- design should be user-oriented.
- ux markup should have a minimum of screens.
- design should be implementable for developers.

Based on UX requirements and product owner requirements, the following specifications were developed for the UI interface:
- style: minimalism.

The UX scheme was based on the scheme from ProdOwnerView

After clarification of the task, the following changes were made to the customer's UX scheme:
- the side drop-down menu was removed and replaced with a lower central menu

After 1st iteration of Ui developing such changes were made:
- color palette: white, black and shades.

The development of the UI interface was divided into iterations, each of which will be accompanied by consultations with the product owner and development team.

The results of each iteration will be contributed to the repository, accompanied by a link to the Figma document.
