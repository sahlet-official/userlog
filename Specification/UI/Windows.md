# UI requirements for app windows
1. User story. [TODO: issue reference]()<br>
**Clear log confirmation window**.<br>
As a user, I want to have an option to clear the log through the confirmation window to be able to confirm or cancel the action.<br>
   - Acceptance criteria:
     - in the window, there should be a question "Are you sure you want to clear the log?" without quotes;
     - in the window there should be two options that the user can select:
       - Cancel
       - Clear
     - options should be pressable and look different for the user,
       not only text but some additional properties should be different (it is discussable),
       (for example, the Cancel option can be black and the Clear option can be red);
     - when Cancel was pressed - the window closes;
     - when Clear was pressed - the log is cleared and then the window closes;
     - when the system Back button was pressed - the window closes;
     - it should correspond to design requirements [TODO: link should be here]();
